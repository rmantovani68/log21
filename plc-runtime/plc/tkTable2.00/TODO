These are recommendations, not all of the same priority, and not
all necessarily will be implemented.  If you see something you
feel is important, email me and say so.  Very democratic.

* Tcl8 object model will be supported when it is supported in Tk
  (or somewhere else that has good examples for widgets)

* Add Unicode support

* -rowstretchmode fill ignores initial # of rows, or config requests for more.
* interpret 0 rows/cols to be FILL
* add -colstretchmode fill
* scratch stretchmode "fill" in favor of "dynamic" which would monitor
  the max extent of row/col (difficult)

* fix selection routines to properly handle title area movement

* support smooth scrolling of rows/cols

* possible -fill option for tags/cells (col/rowspan idea)
 
* add ability to index by tagname
* overhaul tag mechanism (include way to query for tags on a cell, add
  priority, allow indices like 2,*)

* add forced refresh routine?


**** BUGS *****

MAJOR:

Sol2.5.1/gcc 2.8.1/Tk8.1a2 && WinNT/VC++5
seg fault when you exit Tk without destroying or withdrawing
the table first.  Dies trying to reference TableEventProc.
Problem seems to be that TableEventProc gets unloaded before it can
be called when not used in the primary interpreter, or used as a
loadable library.  Fixed with hack that creates ExitHandler for each
instance of table to make sure it is destroyed before Tcl exits.

MINOR:

Windows: During exposure, not everything is wiped clean properly

If last row is one pixel, it is not redrawn properly
